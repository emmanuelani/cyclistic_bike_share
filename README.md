# **Cyclistic Bike Share - Case Study**
## **Introduction**

* In this project. I'll be working with a fictional company called Cyclistic as a Junior Data Analyst. Cyclistic is a bike sharing company in Chicago. They offer a bike share program that features more than 5800 bikes and 600 docking stations.

* Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

* The business task here is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently which will be used to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

* As a Junior Data Analyst, I have been assigned the task of understanding how annual members and casual riders differ which would guide the marketing strategy team in converting casual riders to annual members.
